# Python_box
A Dockerfile and shell script for creating a Fedora Toolbx  with the following pre-installed:
1. Python
2. Pip - the package installer for Python
3. VSCodium - the open-source version of Visual Studio Code
4. PostgreSQL - a popular open-source SQL database engine
## What is this project?
This project creates a Fedora toolbox with Python, Pip, PostgreSQL, and the VSCodium IDE  pre-installed. As such, it provides a script to get you up and running with a bare bones development environment for writing Python projects. 

## How do I run this? 
To create the toolbox, open a terminal, `cd` into the root directory for this project and run `bash build.sh`. 

Once the script has completed, you can run `toolbox enter python_box` to enter into the development environment. To open VSCodium, type `codium` into the terminal, or `codium \path\to\your\directory` to open VSCodium in a particular location.

## Required dependencies
To run this script, you'll need to have a development environment with bash, Toolbx, and Podman installed. 

## Primer on Toolbx and containerized development environments
[Toolbx](https://github.com/containers/toolbox/) is a project for building containerized development environments built on OCI compliant technologies including Podman and Buildah. It comes pre-installed on Linux Fedora workstations, and is an integral part of developing on Silverblue, Fedora's atomic desktop variant. 

Traditionally, a developer would install whatever applications they need directly onto their laptop. This can lead to several problems: 
1. Loss of time - Setting up a desktop environment for development takes time: multiple of my past employers have had complex wikis for onboarding new developers that, including troubleshooting, could take days or even weeks to complete before new developers were ready to start work. Much of this setup is tedious work that could be automated. 
2. Lack of portability - when I switch to a new laptop, I don't want to have to go back and manually re-setup a significant part of my environment. There should be a way for me to get my old setup back with a simple console command or button click.
3. Lack of Isolation - applications can interact with each other in unexpected ways. Because of this, when running a particular workload, it can be important to be able to setup a 'fresh' environment to ensure that the environment works correctly on its own, and to isolate it from unintended influences.

In contrast with traditional development environments, Toolbx can be used to build and run reproducible, isolated, and portable development environments with a single command. 

## Additional information
This project builds on information in the following blog post, which does a nice job explaining how to use Podman and Toolbox to build and run custom container images.
